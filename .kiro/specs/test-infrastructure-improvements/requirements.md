# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses test infrastructure issues in the sequel-duckdb adapter test suite. Many tests are failing due to incorrect assertions, wrong expectations about dataset types, and improper test setup rather than actual functionality problems. The test infrastructure needs to be improved to properly test the adapter's functionality while being flexible about implementation details.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dataset Type Assertion Fixes

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the sequel-duckdb adapter, I want tests to check functionality rather than exact class types, so that tests pass when the adapter works correctly regardless of internal Sequel implementation details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests check dataset types THEN they SHALL use `respond_to?` or duck typing instead of exact class matching
2. WHEN Sequel creates dataset subclasses THEN tests SHALL accept them as valid datasets
3. WHEN tests verify dataset functionality THEN they SHALL test behavior rather than class hierarchy
4. WHEN new Sequel versions change internal class structures THEN tests SHALL continue to pass

### Requirement 2: Mock Database Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer running tests for the sequel-duckdb adapter, I want the mock database to properly simulate DuckDB behavior, so that SQL generation tests accurately reflect real adapter behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mock database is created THEN it SHALL include DuckDB-specific dataset methods
2. WHEN mock database generates SQL THEN it SHALL use DuckDB syntax rules
3. WHEN mock database handles identifiers THEN it SHALL use DuckDB quoting rules
4. WHEN mock database processes expressions THEN it SHALL use DuckDB literal handling

### Requirement 3: Test Helper Method Improvements

**User Story:** As a developer writing tests for the sequel-duckdb adapter, I want test helper methods that work correctly with DuckDB's SQL syntax variations, so that I can write reliable tests without worrying about syntax differences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `assert_sql` helper is used THEN it SHALL handle DuckDB syntax variations gracefully
2. WHEN SQL comparison is needed THEN helper methods SHALL normalize minor syntax differences
3. WHEN testing SQL patterns THEN helper methods SHALL support flexible matching
4. WHEN debugging test failures THEN helper methods SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 4: Integration Test Setup

**User Story:** As a developer running integration tests for the sequel-duckdb adapter, I want proper test database setup and teardown, so that integration tests run reliably and don't interfere with each other.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests run THEN each test SHALL have a clean database state
2. WHEN tests create tables THEN they SHALL be properly cleaned up after the test
3. WHEN tests insert data THEN it SHALL not affect other tests
4. WHEN tests fail THEN database state SHALL be properly reset for subsequent tests

### Requirement 5: Test Data Management

**User Story:** As a developer writing tests for the sequel-duckdb adapter, I want consistent test data setup utilities, so that I can focus on testing functionality rather than data preparation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests need sample data THEN standardized helper methods SHALL be available
2. WHEN tests need specific table schemas THEN reusable setup methods SHALL be provided
3. WHEN tests need to verify data integrity THEN helper methods SHALL validate expected state
4. WHEN tests need to clean up data THEN helper methods SHALL ensure complete cleanup

### Requirement 6: Error Message Improvements

**User Story:** As a developer debugging failing tests in the sequel-duckdb adapter, I want clear and informative error messages, so that I can quickly identify and fix issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SQL assertion fails THEN the error message SHALL show both expected and actual SQL clearly
2. WHEN dataset type assertion fails THEN the error message SHALL explain what was expected and why
3. WHEN database operation fails THEN the error message SHALL include relevant context
4. WHEN test setup fails THEN the error message SHALL indicate the specific setup step that failed

### Requirement 7: Test Organization and Naming

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the sequel-duckdb adapter test suite, I want tests to be well-organized and clearly named, so that I can easily understand what each test covers and find relevant tests when debugging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are grouped by functionality THEN the grouping SHALL be logical and consistent
2. WHEN test methods are named THEN the names SHALL clearly describe what is being tested
3. WHEN tests cover edge cases THEN they SHALL be clearly identified as such
4. WHEN tests are added THEN they SHALL follow established naming and organization patterns

### Requirement 8: Test Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer running the sequel-duckdb adapter test suite, I want tests to run quickly and efficiently, so that I can get fast feedback during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests run THEN they SHALL complete quickly without database connections
2. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL use efficient database operations
3. WHEN test suite runs THEN it SHALL minimize redundant setup and teardown operations
4. WHEN tests are parallelized THEN they SHALL not interfere with each other

### Requirement 9: Test Coverage Validation

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the sequel-duckdb adapter, I want to ensure comprehensive test coverage, so that all functionality is properly tested and regressions are caught early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new functionality is added THEN corresponding tests SHALL be required
2. WHEN tests are removed THEN coverage impact SHALL be evaluated
3. WHEN test coverage is measured THEN it SHALL include both unit and integration tests
4. WHEN coverage gaps are identified THEN they SHALL be prioritized for additional testing
