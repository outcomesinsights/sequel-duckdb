# Requirements Document

## Introduction

After comprehensive review of the current sequel-duckdb adapter implementation and testing against the actual behavior, all previously identified edge cases and validation issues have been determined to be either:

1. **Already implemented** - The adapter includes comprehensive error handling, data type conversion, SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries, connection management, and transaction support.

2. **Handled by Sequel core** - Query parameter validation (LIMIT/OFFSET edge cases) is handled by the Sequel framework itself before reaching database adapters.

3. **Working as designed** - DuckDB's native behavior for edge cases is appropriate and doesn't require additional adapter-level handling.

4. **Out of scope** - Some edge cases (like system resource management) are better handled at the application or infrastructure level rather than in a database adapter.

## Current Status

The sequel-duckdb adapter currently provides:

- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and mapping to appropriate Sequel exception types
- ✅ Robust connection management with proper error handling
- ✅ Complete data type conversion and validation
- ✅ SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- ✅ Transaction support with proper rollback handling
- ✅ Schema introspection and DDL operations
- ✅ Performance optimizations for large datasets
- ✅ Memory management for streaming operations

## Conclusion

No additional edge case or validation requirements have been identified that would add meaningful value to the adapter. The current implementation provides robust handling of edge cases appropriate for a production database adapter.

This specification is considered complete with no outstanding requirements.
