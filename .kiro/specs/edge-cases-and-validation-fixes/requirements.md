# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses edge cases, validation issues, and test inconsistencies in the sequel-duckdb adapter. Some failing tests represent legitimate edge cases that need proper handling, while others represent test issues or unrealistic expectations that should be corrected. This specification aims to distinguish between valid edge cases that need implementation and test issues that need correction.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Query Validation Edge Cases

**User Story:** As a developer using Sequel with DuckDB, I want proper validation of query parameters and edge cases, so that invalid queries are caught early with clear error messages rather than causing database errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use LIMIT with zero THEN it SHALL either be handled gracefully or provide a clear error message
2. WHEN I use OFFSET without LIMIT THEN it SHALL work correctly or provide appropriate guidance
3. WHEN I use empty table names THEN it SHALL raise an appropriate ArgumentError
4. WHEN I use invalid column names THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 2: Data Type Edge Cases

**User Story:** As a developer using Sequel with DuckDB, I want proper handling of edge cases in data type conversion and validation, so that boundary values and special cases work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use very large integers THEN they SHALL be handled within DuckDB's limits
2. WHEN I use very long strings THEN they SHALL be processed correctly or provide appropriate limits
3. WHEN I use Unicode strings THEN they SHALL be properly encoded and stored
4. WHEN I use binary data THEN it SHALL be correctly converted to DuckDB's BLOB format

### Requirement 3: SQL Injection Prevention

**User Story:** As a developer using Sequel with DuckDB, I want protection against SQL injection attacks, so that user input is properly sanitized and cannot compromise database security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use user input in queries THEN it SHALL be properly escaped and quoted
2. WHEN I use special characters in string values THEN they SHALL be safely handled
3. WHEN I use potentially malicious input THEN it SHALL be neutralized without affecting functionality
4. WHEN I use parameterized queries THEN parameters SHALL be safely bound

### Requirement 4: Model Integration Edge Cases

**User Story:** As a developer using Sequel models with DuckDB, I want proper handling of edge cases in model operations, so that ORM functionality works reliably in all scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I update model records THEN the correct number of affected rows SHALL be returned
2. WHEN I delete model records THEN bulk operations SHALL work correctly
3. WHEN I use model associations THEN they SHALL work with DuckDB's SQL syntax
4. WHEN I use model validations THEN they SHALL integrate properly with DuckDB constraints

### Requirement 5: Connection Edge Cases

**User Story:** As a developer using the sequel-duckdb adapter, I want robust handling of connection edge cases, so that connection issues are handled gracefully with appropriate error messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database files are locked THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be provided
2. WHEN database paths are invalid THEN clear error messages SHALL indicate the issue
3. WHEN memory limits are exceeded THEN errors SHALL be properly categorized and reported
4. WHEN connections are lost THEN reconnection SHALL be handled appropriately

### Requirement 6: Schema Operation Edge Cases

**User Story:** As a developer using schema operations with the sequel-duckdb adapter, I want proper handling of edge cases in DDL operations, so that schema changes work reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create tables with complex column types THEN they SHALL be properly mapped to DuckDB types
2. WHEN I modify existing tables THEN changes SHALL be applied correctly
3. WHEN I drop tables with dependencies THEN appropriate error handling SHALL occur
4. WHEN I use reserved words as identifiers THEN they SHALL be properly quoted

### Requirement 7: Performance Edge Cases

**User Story:** As a developer using the sequel-duckdb adapter with large datasets, I want proper handling of performance edge cases, so that the adapter remains stable under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I process very large result sets THEN memory usage SHALL be controlled
2. WHEN I perform bulk operations THEN they SHALL complete within reasonable time limits
3. WHEN I use complex queries THEN they SHALL not cause excessive resource consumption
4. WHEN I reach system limits THEN appropriate errors SHALL be raised

### Requirement 8: Test Expectation Corrections

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the sequel-duckdb adapter test suite, I want tests to have realistic expectations that align with DuckDB's capabilities and Sequel's behavior, so that tests accurately reflect the adapter's functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests check for unsupported features THEN they SHALL be marked as pending or removed
2. WHEN tests have unrealistic expectations THEN they SHALL be corrected to match actual behavior
3. WHEN tests check implementation details THEN they SHALL focus on functionality instead
4. WHEN tests are inconsistent with DuckDB behavior THEN they SHALL be aligned with DuckDB's actual behavior

### Requirement 9: Error Message Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer using the sequel-duckdb adapter, I want consistent and helpful error messages across all edge cases, so that I can quickly understand and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation errors occur THEN error messages SHALL be clear and actionable
2. WHEN database errors occur THEN they SHALL be properly mapped to Sequel exception types
3. WHEN edge cases are encountered THEN error messages SHALL provide context and suggestions
4. WHEN errors occur in different contexts THEN message formatting SHALL be consistent

### Requirement 10: Backward Compatibility for Edge Cases

**User Story:** As a developer upgrading the sequel-duckdb adapter, I want edge case handling to maintain backward compatibility where possible, so that existing code continues to work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN edge case behavior changes THEN it SHALL be documented in changelog
2. WHEN breaking changes are necessary THEN migration guidance SHALL be provided
3. WHEN new validations are added THEN they SHALL not break existing valid usage
4. WHEN error handling improves THEN it SHALL not change the fundamental behavior of working code
