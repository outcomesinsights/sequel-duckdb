# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a complete Ruby Sequel database adapter for DuckDB. The adapter will enable Ruby applications to use DuckDB as a backend database through the Sequel ORM, providing full compatibility with Sequel's API and conventions. The implementation will follow the patterns established in existing Sequel adapters, with jeremyevans/sequel as the primary reference, sequel-hexspace as secondary reference for adapter structure, and sequel_impala as tertiary reference for implementation patterns, while leveraging the official ruby-duckdb gem for database connectivity.

## Requirements
