# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses database schema and setup issues in integration tests for the sequel-duckdb adapter. Many integration tests are failing because they attempt to perform database operations on tables that don't exist or haven't been properly set up. The test infrastructure needs proper database setup, schema management, and teardown procedures to ensure integration tests run reliably.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Automatic Test Database Setup

**User Story:** As a developer running integration tests for the sequel-duckdb adapter, I want test databases to be automatically set up with required schemas, so that tests can focus on functionality rather than database preparation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests start THEN required test tables SHALL be automatically created
2. WHEN tests need specific schemas THEN they SHALL be set up before test execution
3. WHEN tests require sample data THEN it SHALL be inserted during setup
4. WHEN test setup fails THEN clear error messages SHALL indicate the specific failure

### Requirement 2: Test Table Schema Management

**User Story:** As a developer writing integration tests for the sequel-duckdb adapter, I want standardized test table schemas that cover all data types and scenarios, so that I can test comprehensive functionality without custom setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests need a users table THEN it SHALL include common columns (id, name, email, age, active, created_at)
2. WHEN tests need type testing THEN tables SHALL include all supported DuckDB data types
3. WHEN tests need relationship testing THEN foreign key relationships SHALL be properly set up
4. WHEN tests need constraint testing THEN appropriate constraints SHALL be defined

### Requirement 3: Test Data Fixtures

**User Story:** As a developer running integration tests for the sequel-duckdb adapter, I want consistent test data fixtures, so that tests produce predictable results and can be easily debugged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests need sample users THEN standardized user records SHALL be available
2. WHEN tests need relational data THEN properly linked records SHALL be provided
3. WHEN tests need edge case data THEN fixtures SHALL include boundary values and special cases
4. WHEN tests need large datasets THEN performance test fixtures SHALL be available

### Requirement 4: Database Cleanup and Isolation

**User Story:** As a developer running integration tests for the sequel-duckdb adapter, I want each test to run in isolation with a clean database state, so that tests don't interfere with each other and produce consistent results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN each test starts THEN it SHALL have a clean database state
2. WHEN tests modify data THEN changes SHALL not affect subsequent tests
3. WHEN tests create temporary tables THEN they SHALL be cleaned up after the test
4. WHEN tests fail THEN database state SHALL be reset for the next test

### Requirement 5: Schema Introspection Test Support

**User Story:** As a developer testing schema introspection features of the sequel-duckdb adapter, I want test databases with comprehensive schema elements, so that I can verify all introspection functionality works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing table listing THEN multiple test tables SHALL exist
2. WHEN testing column introspection THEN tables SHALL have diverse column types and properties
3. WHEN testing index introspection THEN various index types SHALL be present
4. WHEN testing constraint introspection THEN different constraint types SHALL be available

### Requirement 6: Transaction Testing Support

**User Story:** As a developer testing transaction functionality of the sequel-duckdb adapter, I want test scenarios that properly exercise transaction behavior, so that I can verify commit, rollback, and isolation work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing transactions THEN test data SHALL support rollback verification
2. WHEN testing nested transactions THEN appropriate test scenarios SHALL be available
3. WHEN testing transaction isolation THEN concurrent test scenarios SHALL be supported
4. WHEN testing transaction errors THEN error conditions SHALL be reproducible

### Requirement 7: Performance Testing Database Setup

**User Story:** As a developer testing performance aspects of the sequel-duckdb adapter, I want test databases with appropriate data volumes, so that I can verify performance optimizations work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing bulk operations THEN large datasets SHALL be available
2. WHEN testing query performance THEN indexed and non-indexed scenarios SHALL be set up
3. WHEN testing memory usage THEN datasets of various sizes SHALL be available
4. WHEN testing streaming THEN large result sets SHALL be available for testing

### Requirement 8: Error Condition Testing Setup

**User Story:** As a developer testing error handling in the sequel-duckdb adapter, I want test scenarios that reliably reproduce error conditions, so that I can verify proper error handling and exception mapping.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing constraint violations THEN tables with constraints SHALL be available
2. WHEN testing connection errors THEN invalid database scenarios SHALL be reproducible
3. WHEN testing SQL errors THEN scenarios that trigger DuckDB errors SHALL be available
4. WHEN testing type errors THEN incompatible data scenarios SHALL be set up

### Requirement 9: Test Database Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer running integration tests for the sequel-duckdb adapter, I want flexible test database configuration, so that tests can run in different environments and scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run in CI THEN database configuration SHALL be automatically appropriate
2. WHEN tests run locally THEN database configuration SHALL support development workflows
3. WHEN tests need specific DuckDB settings THEN configuration SHALL be easily adjustable
4. WHEN tests need different database sizes THEN memory limits SHALL be configurable

### Requirement 10: Test Helper Integration

**User Story:** As a developer writing integration tests for the sequel-duckdb adapter, I want test helpers that work seamlessly with the database setup, so that I can write tests efficiently without boilerplate code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using test helpers THEN they SHALL work with the established database schema
2. WHEN creating test data THEN helpers SHALL use the standardized fixtures
3. WHEN verifying results THEN helpers SHALL understand the test database structure
4. WHEN cleaning up THEN helpers SHALL properly reset database state
