# Design Document: Advanced SQL Features Implementation

## Overview

Most advanced SQL features are already implemented. This focuses on verification, testing, and minor enhancements.

**Status:**
- JOIN USING, recursive CTEs, set operations, error handling: ✅ Implemented
- Window functions: ✅ Basic support exists
- DuckDB configuration: ✅ Basic PRAGMA support exists

**Remaining Work:**
- Test window functions with actual DuckDB
- Test advanced expressions (arrays, JSON)
- Add user-friendly configuration methods
- Integration testing

## Implementation Approach

1. **Test existing functionality** - Verify implemented features work correctly
2. **Add convenience methods** - User-friendly configuration interface
3. **Integration testing** - Test with actual DuckDB databases

This is primarily testing and verification, not new feature implementation.
