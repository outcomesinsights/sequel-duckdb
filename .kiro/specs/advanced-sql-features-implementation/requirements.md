# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Most advanced SQL features are already implemented. This focuses on remaining verification and testing needs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Window Function Verification

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify window functions work correctly with DuckDB.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use window functions THEN they SHALL generate correct SQL and execute properly
2. WHEN I use LAG/LEAD functions THEN they SHALL support offset and default parameters

### Requirement 2: Advanced Expression Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test advanced DuckDB expressions work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use array syntax THEN it SHALL use DuckDB's `[1, 2, 3]` format
2. WHEN I use JSON functions THEN they SHALL work with DuckDB's JSON support

### Requirement 3: Configuration Interface Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want user-friendly configuration methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use `db.set_pragma(key, value)` THEN it SHALL execute PRAGMA statements
2. WHEN I use `db.configure_duckdb(options)` THEN it SHALL apply multiple settings

### Requirement 4: Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive integration tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run tests THEN all advanced features SHALL work with actual DuckDB databases
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be properly mapped to Sequel exceptions
