# Content checks inherited from overcommit when it was removed (2026-09-12):
# MergeConflicts, YamlSyntax, JsonSyntax. RuboCop and the test target were already
# covered by fmt-check/lint/test; HardTabs and TrailingWhitespace were dropped because
# they fight shfmt, .tsv, and generated files. See habituate/standards.md.
